# Plan 063 — Packaged macOS VM QA

Status: IN PROGRESS — final action checks reproduced Saved text and Dock-overlap defects; fixes under verification.
Baseline: PR #140, `37eea0229e3b2c391315c4235068af1212d80f36`.

## Scope

Run the packaged macOS ARM app in an isolated Tart guest, preserving the host
desktop and user profile. Exercise onboarding, recording/insertion, recovery,
settings and the primary pages. Fix only reproduced defects in the release scope.
Windows ARM builds and broad redesigns are deferred. No scheduled polling.

## Environment and limits

VM workspace: `/Volumes/1tb-drive/qa/voicetypr-vm`.
Guest-only CuaDriver/VNC control, virtual audio input, synthetic speech and
disposable settings. Candidate is an ad hoc signed release build, not a notarized
public installer. VM results do not establish physical microphone/GPU parity or
Windows runtime correctness. Existing unperformed hardware checks remain open.

## Reproduced finding

Fresh onboarding: select a local model, grant permissions, save the hotkey,
turn both reporting options off, then finish setup. The app immediately opens
another privacy dialog with both switches on. Determine whether the stale state
is visual or persisted, fix the handoff, and prove off choices persist after
relaunch. Evidence is in `evidence/01-onboarding-consent-off.png` and
`evidence/02-duplicate-consent-after-onboarding.png` under the VM workspace.

## Acceptance

Record exact artifact identity and observed runtime outcomes. Test confirmed
fixes through the real flow after repackaging. Preserve consent and license
fixtures; no customer data resets, provider deletion, support submissions or
release publication as a side effect of QA. Keep release smoke limitations
explicit in the final report.

## Confirmed fixes — rebuilt VM verification

- Onboarding persisted OFF/OFF correctly, but published completion before the
  writes finished, so the main app opened a stale default-on dialog. Persist
  consent first and publish onboarding completion only after settings save.
  Failed saves leave the same step recoverable with the user's selections.
- Fresh startup without Accessibility failed to start the shortcut engine.
  Later successful permission polling did not emit the event that retries it.
  Authorized checks now notify the existing retry listener; concurrent starts
  remain idempotent. The old build started its engine only after relaunch;
  the same guest VNC shortcut then recorded and inserted successfully.
- Empty Overview displayed “Busiest · 1”. Display the actual zero maximum and
  keep a separate safe denominator for chart geometry.

Integrated local validation: 727 frontend tests, typecheck, lint and production
build pass; 1,548 Rust workspace tests pass with 16 ignored, and Clippy across
all targets passes with warnings denied. Independent review cleared the final
patch after correcting settings-save publication and zero chart geometry.

Old-candidate VM evidence: startup, permission gating, Base English download and
checksum verification, selection, consent persistence, and post-relaunch
record→transcribe→insert completed. Clipboard sentinel was restored. The first
diagnostic run contained prolonged silence and extra recognized words; a short
controlled run also had a word-level recognition mismatch. Do not treat either
as exact transcription-accuracy proof or infer a recorder defect without audio
comparison. Both paths returned to Idle and saved History entries.

Rebuilt candidate `9d5248ab` passed the three regressions in the guest: initial
Accessibility denial produced an engine-start failure; the later permission
recheck started the engine in the same process, and the physical VNC shortcut
completed recording, transcription and TextEdit insertion. Both onboarding
reporting choices were off, no duplicate dialog appeared, and persisted values
remained false. Empty Overview showed zero activity without a busiest-day badge.

All primary pages were inspected at the guest's 1024×768 logical display size:
Overview, General, History, Upload, Sources (Local/Cloud/Remote), Recording,
Polish, Shortcuts, Network sharing, CLI, License, Quick help, Report a problem.
Local upload transcription, clipboard copy, transcript file save/readback,
History empty search, CLI installation/status, loopback remote transcription,
server shutdown and double-Escape cancellation passed. Cancellation returned to
Idle and removed the canceled recording. No provider keys, license activation,
report submission or host UI operations were used.

The CLI page's copied agent prompt was also reproduced as invalid: it omitted
the parser's required `--file` flag. Corrected the example and its existing copy
assertion; the real guest CLI accepted the corrected syntax. Final package
`6c09035ccab38739f50d20c6be7018a99a3653e6` displayed and copied the corrected
prompt. Its 2400×1600 share-card PNG export also passed visual inspection.

Recognition limits: the rebuilt controlled sentence and uploaded source both
matched the synthetic fixture, but this is not general accuracy proof. A very
short file was rejected by the existing 0.5-second engine minimum after
preparation. A three-second zero-audio CLI input produced `you`; silence
hallucination prevention is therefore not passed. No speculative speech gate
was added, and physical short/soft-speech and end-of-capture checks remain open.

Final-package recording: a cached Whisper instance failed with inference code
`-6`; the failure toast appeared, clipboard stayed intact, and the app returned
to Idle. A fresh CLI instance succeeded. After a normal app restart, the same
loopback sentence inserted correctly, followed by a separate `Sure.` recording
without another restart. Cause of the intermittent VM inference failure is
unestablished; physical GPU stability is not passed. Replacing the ad hoc bundle
also required refreshing guest TCC grants using the exact installed app path;
this does not establish signed-update permission continuity.

License fixtures on `9d5248ab`: malformed JSON and valid-length unauthenticatable
ciphertext each retained identical bytes through repeated License Retry,
normal tray Quit, relaunch, and another normal Quit. License remained Unknown
with reachable Retry, without expired-trial fallback. Fixture-period logs had
no trial-check marker, synthetic payload, or ciphertext. The original absent
secure store was restored after preserving fixtures; ordinary trial status
returned. No entitlement was activated/deactivated. Valid paid-store behavior
and network-level request capture were not exercised.

## Deliverables and remaining gates

Follow-up action checks on `6c09035c` reproduced two additional defects. Saved
text trigger `insert qa signature` did not match the engine's ordinary
`Insert QA Signature.` output; tolerate one terminal sentence mark only after
checking exact trigger matches. Separately, the default bottom-center pill was
behind a visible Dock: enabling Dock autohide in the guest revealed the same
pill at the same position. Guest Dock defaults were restored after recording
both screenshots. Keep the overlay within the available desktop area and
retest with the Dock visible. Local correction rules worked with AI Polish off.

Both follow-up fixes are implemented and independently reviewed. Saved text
checks exact eligible triggers first, then tolerates one trailing ASCII `.`,
`!`, or `?` only for an unpunctuated whole trigger. macOS startup and subsequent
placement use Tauri's monitor work area, backed by `NSScreen.visibleFrame`,
with bounds/scale validation and pill/toast clamping. Non-macOS startup and
runtime geometry retain their previous behavior. Integrated validation after
these changes: 1,555 Rust workspace tests passed, 16 ignored; workspace/all-target
Clippy passed with warnings denied; full workspace formatting passed. Packaged
verification of these two follow-up fixes is pending.

Final ad hoc bundle, ZIP and build manifest are under
`candidate-6c09035c/local-arm64-adhoc/` in the VM workspace. ZIP SHA-256:
`8e31bef9f06c5c17964f8494fe758e8e6abd3305c2f3f4f97e5395a6ac2b088b`.
Screenshots, the exported card and guest-only diagnostics are in `evidence/`.

Completion of the scoped VM pass does not complete the release matrix. Real Windows and
physical macOS microphone/GPU/media/device-change checks, signed updater and
notarization, real cloud/Polish provider accounts, Soniox cleanup ownership,
analytics ingestion, and support/alert delivery remain unverified. No beta or
Stable release is implied. Existing SMOKE rows remain unchecked where their
full acceptance conditions were not performed.
