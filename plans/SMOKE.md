# Pending manual smoke — consolidated checklist

All code below is implemented, gate-green, and committed. The ONLY remaining
work is interactive desktop smoke, batched (per product owner) to run once at
the end of the current feature push, before release. Do NOT re-implement
anything here; executors and agents treat these plans as code-frozen.

Run on a real macOS machine via `pnpm tauri dev` (item 16-S8 needs a Windows
build). Check each box with date + result; on failure, file the failure
against the named plan instead of hot-fixing inline.

## Plan 004 — cancel during `Starting` (code at `9868fdc` era, NEEDS-SMOKE)

- [ ] 004-S1 Toggle mode: record hotkey, immediately press Escape repeatedly
      during startup → ends Idle, no stuck pill, next record starts fresh.
- [ ] 004-S2 PTT mode: hold PTT, release during init → recorder stops
      (`PTT_START_ABORTED_AFTER_RELEASE` path).
- [ ] 004-S3 Normal record/stop/transcribe → unchanged.

## Plan 008 — audio callback hot path (NEEDS-SMOKE)

- [ ] 008-S1 Normal dictation: 10 s record → text appears; WAV plays back
      cleanly if `save_recordings` on.
- [ ] 008-S2 Long recording 3+ min → no unbounded memory growth, transcript
      complete.
- [ ] 008-S3 Stop variants: hotkey stop, Escape cancel, silence auto-stop →
      all return to Idle, no leftover temp files.
- [ ] 008-S4 Device yank: unplug/switch input mid-recording → graceful stop.
      (Safety-critical: misbehavior here is a release blocker.)

## Plan 015 — pipeline feel / never-stuck (code at `b1a66bf`, NEEDS-SMOKE)

- [ ] 015-S1 Sound ON, wired/builtin mic: hotkey → speak immediately → first
      word present in transcript.
- [ ] 015-S2 Sound ON, Bluetooth headset (if available): chime may clip but
      transcription must include first word.
- [ ] 015-S3 Esc-cancel mid-decode of a ~60 s recording on CPU Whisper →
      pill idle within ~1 s (abort callback).
- [ ] 015-S4 Parakeet: cancel during transcription → pill idle, next
      recording works (sidecar respawn + model reload).
- [ ] 015-S5 Force a formatting hard-failure → toast appears, transcript in
      clipboard, entry in history, state returns to idle.

## Plan 016 — AI polish Rust-native cutover (code at `fb09a61`, NEEDS-SMOKE)

Already auto-proven (no manual re-check needed): invalid OpenAI/Gemini/
Anthropic keys rejected against live endpoints; unreachable custom base URL
→ Network error; failure-path delivery/save/notice covered by unit tests.

- [ ] 016-S2 Valid-key end-to-end polish for two real provider families
      (e.g. OpenAI + Gemini): dictate → polished text inserts at cursor.
- [ ] 016-S3 Forced polish failure (cut network or bad custom URL after a
      valid setup): raw/deterministic text still inserts + "polish failed"
      notice; app stays responsive.
- [ ] 016-S4 Custom base URL with bad endpoint does not persist in settings.
- [ ] 016-S5 Provider switch restores per-provider remembered model.
- [ ] 016-S6 Quit app mid-polish: no crash, no half-written history/settings.
- [ ] 016-S7 Fresh build launches + polishes with no formatting sidecar
      present in the bundle.
- [ ] 016-S8 Windows build: one real polish call (TLS/proxy path) +
      migration from a pre-cutover settings file (`google` provider id).

## Release rule

015 + 016 smoke are ship gates for the AI-polish release; 004/008 smoke are
ship gates for the recording-path release. None block further feature
development on this branch.
