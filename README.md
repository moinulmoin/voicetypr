## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Windows GPU Acceleration

VoiceTypr automatically detects and uses your GPU for faster transcription. If you're experiencing slower performance:

1. **Update your graphics drivers** - This is the most common fix:
   - [NVIDIA Drivers](https://www.nvidia.com/drivers)
   - [AMD Drivers](https://www.amd.com/support)
   - [Intel Drivers](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/products/80939/graphics.html)

2. **Check logs** - Enable debug logging in Settings to see if GPU is being used

3. **Verify GPU support** - Modern GPUs (2016+) should work automatically

> **Note**: VoiceTypr always works - it automatically falls back to CPU if GPU acceleration is unavailable
