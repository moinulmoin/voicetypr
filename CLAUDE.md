# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

VoiceTypr is a native desktop app for macOS that provides offline voice transcription using Whisper. Built with Tauri v2 (Rust) and React with TypeScript.

### Key Features
- üéôÔ∏è **Voice Recording**: System-wide hotkey triggered recording
- ü§ñ **Offline Transcription**: Uses Whisper AI models locally
- üìù **Auto-insert**: Transcribed text automatically inserted at cursor
- üéØ **Model Management**: Download and switch between Whisper models
- ‚ö° **Native Performance**: Rust backend with React frontend

## Development Guidelines

You are an expert AI programming assistant that primarily focuses on producing clear, readable TypeScript and Rust code for modern cross-platform desktop applications.

You always use the latest versions of Tauri, Rust, React, and you are familiar with the latest features, best practices, and patterns associated with these technologies.

  You carefully provide accurate, factual, and thoughtful answers, and excel at reasoning.
- Follow the user‚Äôs requirements carefully & to the letter.
- Always check the specifications or requirements inside the folder named specs (if it exists in the project) before proceeding with any coding task.
- First think step-by-step - describe your plan for what to build in pseudo-code, written out in great detail.
- Confirm the approach with the user, then proceed to write code!
- Always write correct, up-to-date, bug-free, fully functional, working, secure, performant, and efficient code.
- Focus on readability over performance, unless otherwise specified.
- Fully implement all requested functionality.
- Leave NO todos, placeholders, or missing pieces in your code.
- Use TypeScript‚Äôs type system to catch errors early, ensuring type safety and clarity.
- Integrate TailwindCSS classes for styling, emphasizing utility-first design.
- Utilize ShadCN-UI components effectively, adhering to best practices for component-driven architecture.
- Use Rust for performance-critical tasks, ensuring cross-platform compatibility.
- Ensure seamless integration between Tauri, Rust, and React for a smooth desktop experience.
- Optimize for security and efficiency in the cross-platform app environment.
- Be concise. Minimize any unnecessary prose in your explanations.
- If there might not be a correct answer, state so. If you do not know the answer, admit it instead of guessing.
- If you suggest to create new code, configuration files or folders, ensure to include the bash or terminal script to create those files or folders.

## Development Commands

```bash
# Start development
pnpm dev          # Frontend only (Vite dev server)
pnpm tauri dev    # Full Tauri app development

# Testing
pnpm test         # Run all frontend tests
pnpm test:watch   # Run tests in watch mode
cd src-tauri && cargo test  # Run backend tests

# Build production app
pnpm tauri build  # Creates native .app bundle

# Code quality
pnpm lint         # Run ESLint
pnpm typecheck    # Run TypeScript compiler
```

## Architecture

### Frontend (React + TypeScript)
- **UI Components**: Pre-built shadcn/ui components in `src/components/ui/`
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4 with custom configuration
- **State Management**: React hooks + Tauri events
- **Error Handling**: React Error Boundaries for graceful failures
- **Path Aliases**: `@/*` maps to `./src/*`

### Backend (Rust + Tauri)
- **Source**: `src-tauri/src/`
- **Modules**:
  - `audio/`: Audio recording with CoreAudio
  - `whisper/`: Whisper model management and transcription
  - `commands/`: Tauri command handlers
- **Capabilities**: Define permissions in `src-tauri/capabilities/`

### Testing Philosophy

#### Backend Testing
- Comprehensive unit tests for all business logic
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Focus on correctness and reliability

#### Frontend Testing
- **User-focused**: Test what users see and do, not implementation details
- **Integration over unit**: Test complete user journeys
- **Key test files**:
  - `App.critical.test.tsx`: Critical user paths
  - `App.user.test.tsx`: Common user scenarios
  - Component tests: Only for complex behavior

### Current Project Status

‚úÖ **Completed**:
- Core recording and transcription functionality
- Model download and management
- Settings persistence
- Comprehensive test suite (110+ tests)
- Error boundaries and recovery
- Global hotkey support

### Key Technical Decisions

1. **Tauri v2**: For native performance and small bundle size
2. **Whisper.cpp**: For fast, offline transcription
3. **React Query**: For server state management (planned)
4. **Vitest**: Modern, fast test runner
5. **User-focused testing**: Test behavior, not implementation

### Common Patterns

1. **Error Handling**: Always wrap risky operations in try-catch
2. **Loading States**: Show clear feedback during async operations
3. **Graceful Degradation**: App should work even if some features fail
4. **Type Safety**: Use TypeScript strictly, avoid `any`
